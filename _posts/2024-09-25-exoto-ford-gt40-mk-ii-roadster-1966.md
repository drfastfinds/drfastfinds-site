  <h2>Winner, 1966 Sebring 12 Hours</h2>
  <p>Driven by <strong>Ken Miles</strong> and <strong>Lloyd Ruby</strong>, the <strong>Ford GT40 MK II Roadster</strong> took a surprising victory at the 1966 Sebring 12 Hours. The car, previously known as the <em>Ford X-1</em>, was converted to Mk II specifications by Kar Kraft for Shelby American. After testing several transmissions in early practice sessions, the car finally found success with a standard gearbox, leading it to a legendary win.</p>

  <h2>History and Performance</h2>
  <p>Originally delivered to <strong>Shelby American</strong> and dubbed the "Ford X-1," the GT40 Roadster was lighter than its coupe counterpart while retaining the same powerful 7-liter V8 engine. In the 1966 Sebring race, the roadster held its own against Ferrari's 330P3, with Miles and Ruby taking it easy during qualifying but still achieving the fifth fastest time.</p>

  <p>During the race, Ken Miles started the #1 Roadster, keeping pace with the Ferrari until his Ford teammate, Dan Gurney, suffered engine failure just a quarter-mile from the finish line. Miles took advantage of the opportunity, crossing the line in first place and claiming victory in what would be the GT40 Roadster's first and last race.</p>
