  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Tamiya Toyota Gazoo Racing TS050 Hybrid</strong> scale model kit is a tribute to one of the most advanced endurance race cars in history. This kit replicates the Toyota TS050 Hybrid, a car that competed in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) and earned a historic victory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. With its revolutionary hybrid technology and stunning performance, the TS050 Hybrid marks Toyota’s relentless pursuit of endurance racing glory.</p>

  <h2>The TS050 Hybrid: Engineering Masterpiece</h2>
  <p>The TS050 Hybrid debuted in 2016 as the successor to Toyota's TS040 Hybrid. It replaced the naturally aspirated 3.7L V8 engine with a 2.4L twin-turbo V6, combined with an 8MJ hybrid system. This hybrid system consists of motor-generator units (MGUs) at both the front and rear, working with a high-powered lithium-ion battery to generate an additional 500PS, for a combined total of 1000PS (735kW). With cutting-edge advancements in aerodynamics, the TS050 Hybrid was built to meet the stringent challenges of the WEC.</p>

  <h2>Near Victory at Le Mans 2016</h2>
  <p>In the 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans, Toyota seemed poised to clinch a long-awaited victory, having previously finished second in 1992, 1994, 1999, and 2013. The No. 5 TS050 led the race with less than 10 minutes to go, only for a tragic loss of power to dash their hopes, handing victory to Porsche. This heartbreak pushed Toyota to improve further, leading to future triumphs.</p>

  <h2>2017: Chasing Redemption</h2>
  <p>The 2017 season saw a new and improved TS050 Hybrid with a highly optimized hybrid powertrain, refined aerodynamics, and an upgraded V6 turbocharged engine that enhanced thermal efficiency. Toyota’s determination to win its first Le Mans victory pushed the team to its limits. Kamui Kobayashi set a lap record during qualifying at Le Mans in 2017 with a time of 3:14.791, showcasing the raw speed of the TS050 Hybrid.</p>

  <h2>End of an Era</h2>
  <p>The TS050 Hybrid continued to dominate in the WEC and eventually claimed victory at the 2019-2020 Le Mans race. Despite its dominance, the 2020 Le Mans marked the final race for the TS050, as Toyota shifted its focus to the new hypercar regulations. The legacy of this remarkable car lives on through its iconic victories and groundbreaking engineering.</p>
