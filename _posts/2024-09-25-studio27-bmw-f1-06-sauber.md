  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The <strong>BMW F1.06 Sauber</strong> was a single-seater car raced by the BMW Sauber team in the 2006 Formula One season. It was driven by Nick Heidfeld, who joined from Williams, and Jacques Villeneuve, who was later replaced by Robert Kubica. This marked the first year BMW competed as a full team after previously supplying engines.</p>
  
  <p>Although the 2006 season was viewed as transitional, the F1.06 exceeded expectations, becoming a points contender throughout the year. The car achieved two podium finishes: one for Heidfeld at the Hungarian Grand Prix and another for Kubica in Italy. The BMW Sauber team finished fifth in the Constructors' Championship, accumulating 36 points. Notably, the car featured innovative designs, such as a flexible rear wing and vertical pylons, which sparked some controversy during the season.</p>
