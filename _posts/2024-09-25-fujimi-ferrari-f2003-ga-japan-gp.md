  <h2>About the F2003-GA</h2>
  <p>The F2003-GA was developed as an evolution of the championship-winning F2002 and featured several key design upgrades. Designed by a talented team including Rory Byrne and Ross Brawn, the car incorporated new aerodynamic elements like bulbous sidepods and a lengthened wheelbase to enhance its performance. The "GA" designation was added to honor Gianni Agnelli, the late head of Fiat.</p>

  <h2>Racing History</h2>
  <p>This model also comes with official Marlboro decals, allowing you to replicate the original livery that Ferrari used throughout the season, except at select Grands Prix where tobacco branding was restricted. The car itself is a masterpiece of engineering, securing seven race wins, five pole positions, and helping Michael Schumacher claim his sixth Drivers' Championship title, surpassing the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio.</p>
