## Porsche 963: A New Chapter in Endurance Racing

The Porsche 963 is a cutting-edge sports prototype racing car that represents the next evolution of Porsche’s long and storied history in endurance racing. Officially categorized as an LMDh (Le Mans Daytona hybrid) car, it was designed to compete in the Hypercar and GTP (Grand Touring Prototype) classes within both the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) and the IMSA SportsCar Championship. Launched at the 2022 Goodwood Festival of Speed, the Porsche 963 is the latest in a lineage that includes iconic models like the Porsche 956 and Porsche 962.

### The Road to the Porsche 963

After dominating endurance racing with the Porsche 919 Hybrid in the LMP1 category and winning the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2017, Porsche had temporarily stepped away from the top class of sports car racing. However, with the introduction of the LMDh regulations, the German automaker saw an opportunity to return to endurance racing’s highest echelons. These regulations allow manufacturers to compete in both WEC and IMSA with cost-effective, hybridized prototype vehicles built around a shared chassis.

In December 2020, Porsche confirmed it was developing an LMDh program, with Multimatic supplying the carbon-fiber chassis, and Penske Motorsport managing factory efforts under the banner of Porsche Penske Motorsport. Development tests began in early 2022, with the car quickly covering thousands of kilometers at tracks like Spa-Francorchamps and Barcelona-Catalunya.

### Technical Specifications

The Porsche 963 combines Porsche's racing heritage with cutting-edge technology. The car features a twin-turbocharged 4.6-liter V8 engine, paired with a 50kW hybrid motor, allowing it to deliver a total output of approximately 680 horsepower. The engine is derived from the powertrain of the Porsche RS Spyder and the 918 Spyder, further enhancing Porsche’s racing DNA.

- **Chassis**: Carbon-fiber monocoque with aluminum honeycomb core (LMP2-based)
- **Engine**: 4.6L V8 twin-turbo, 32-valve DOHC, mid-engine, longitudinally mounted
- **Electric Motor**: 50 kW spec MGU supplied by Bosch
- **Transmission**: Xtrac P1359 7-speed sequential manual
- **Weight**: 1,030 kg
- **Brakes**: AP Racing carbon brakes
- **Tyres**: Michelin slicks with BBS forged alloys

The car’s suspension is composed of double wishbones with pushrods, ensuring high precision handling, while the car’s aggressive aerodynamic profile was refined to reduce drag and increase downforce over endurance events.

### Racing Debut and Early Success

The Porsche 963 made its official competitive debut at the 2023 24 Hours of Daytona, marking Porsche’s return to the IMSA SportsCar Championship’s top class. Although the car faced early reliability issues, Porsche quickly bounced back, scoring its first victory in the series at the Grand Prix of Long Beach in 2023.

In the FIA World Endurance Championship, the Porsche 963 showed strong performances throughout its first season, with a significant victory coming at the 6 Hours of Fuji in 2024. The car’s capability, coupled with Porsche Penske Motorsport’s strategy, helped Porsche clinch back-to-back championships in the FIA World Cup for Hypercar Teams.

### A Future of Endurance Racing Dominance

The Porsche 963 is designed not just to compete, but to dominate. The car’s development program is ongoing, with constant improvements in performance and reliability being made as it takes on competitors from Cadillac, Acura, and BMW, among others.

With a clear focus on the future, Porsche continues to push the boundaries of hybrid technology in motorsport, setting its sights on achieving even more success at iconic races like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Daytona, and Sebring. As it stands, the Porsche 963 is more than just a successor to the legendary Porsche 919 Hybrid—it’s a harbinger of what endurance racing will look like in the electrified era.
