  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Porsche 963</strong> is a cutting-edge sports prototype racing car that represents the next evolution of Porsche’s long and storied history in endurance racing. Officially categorized as an LMDh (Le Mans Daytona hybrid) car, it was designed to compete in the Hypercar and GTP (Grand Touring Prototype) classes within both the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) and the IMSA SportsCar Championship.</p>

  <h2>The Road to the Porsche 963</h2>
  <p>After dominating endurance racing with the Porsche 919 Hybrid in the LMP1 category and winning the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2017, Porsche had temporarily stepped away from the top class of sports car racing. However, with the introduction of the LMDh regulations, the German automaker saw an opportunity to return to endurance racing’s highest echelons.</p>
  <p>In December 2020, Porsche confirmed it was developing an LMDh program, with Multimatic supplying the carbon-fiber chassis, and Penske Motorsport managing factory efforts under the banner of Porsche Penske Motorsport. Development tests began in early 2022, with the car quickly covering thousands of kilometers at tracks like Spa-Francorchamps and Barcelona-Catalunya.</p>

  <h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chassis:</strong> Carbon-fiber monocoque with aluminum honeycomb core (LMP2-based)</li>
    <li><strong>Engine:</strong> 4.6L V8 twin-turbo, 32-valve DOHC, mid-engine, longitudinally mounted</li>
    <li><strong>Electric Motor:</strong> 50 kW spec MGU supplied by Bosch</li>
    <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> Xtrac P1359 7-speed sequential manual</li>
    <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 1,030 kg</li>
    <li><strong>Brakes:</strong> AP Racing carbon brakes</li>
    <li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Michelin slicks with BBS forged alloys</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Racing Debut and Early Success</h2>
  <p>The Porsche 963 made its official competitive debut at the 2023 24 Hours of Daytona, marking Porsche’s return to the IMSA SportsCar Championship’s top class. Although the car faced early reliability issues, Porsche quickly bounced back, scoring its first victory in the series at the Grand Prix of Long Beach in 2023.</p>
  <p>In the FIA World Endurance Championship, the Porsche 963 showed strong performances throughout its first season, with a significant victory coming at the 6 Hours of Fuji in 2024.</p>

  <h2>A Future of Endurance Racing Dominance</h2>
  <p>The Porsche 963 is designed not just to compete, but to dominate. With ongoing development, Porsche continues to push the boundaries of hybrid technology in motorsport, aiming for success at iconic races like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Daytona, and Sebring.</p>
